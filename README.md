## Project Overview
You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

## App Description
Your task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.
   
The recipe listing is located [here](http://go.udacity.com/android-baking-app-json) and the app rubric [here.](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/829/view )

App mockups [provided.](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/March/58dee986_bakingapp-mocks/bakingapp-mocks.pdf)
   
The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images you will need to complete this project. Don’t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.
   
One of the skills you will demonstrate in this project is how to handle unexpected input in your data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.
